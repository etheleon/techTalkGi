## Objective of today's talk

1. Appreciation of version revisions
2. Storage vs collaboration: Branching and Merging
3. Types of VCS: Similarities and Differences
4. Centralised eg. Subversion aka SVN
4. Distributed eg. GIT

## VersionControl: **ADVANTAGES**

1. Work parallel
3. Update project to the latest version
2. Backtrack
4. List changes and their details
5. Version control is a safety net

## Advantages 

* Working **concurrently**

## Have the Latest version

```{r eval=FALSE}
$ git pull git@github.com:arduino/Arduino.git
```

## Advantages Backtracking

---

## Advantages: A safety net

* Dropbox only saves up to 5 revisions from the latest version
* No save messages (end up relying on file names)
* works even if you move the file to different folder and rename the file

---
## Available VCSs

* SVN (Today)
* Mercurial
* GIT

---

## SVN: Centralised Version Control System

---

## Working with SVN

* Commad line interfce 
* GUI (Focus for today)
* Official SVN website: https://subversion.apache.org

## Workflow

## DEMO part1: working locally

1. Create Repo
2. Checkout
3. Add Files
4. Status
5. Merge Conflicts
6. ignore filetypes
7. tagging and branching
8. merging branches


---

## Starting A REPO: GUI

## DEMO part2: working with servers

---

## GIT Distributed VCSs

* Gives you the ability to work concurrently and prevents locking. 
* Each user has a full copy of the repository

---
## Git is not Github

---
## Git is not Github
* Github serves many purposes
  * central dump 
  * Wikipedia
  * Issues Submission
* Friendly for code sharing esp open source projects and collaborations (FORKING)
